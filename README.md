# A Things to The Hit List conversion script

## THIS WILL ERASE YOUR THL DATABASE. Keep a backup!

5-second README: 

- Back up your shit
- Run the script
- Observe that your Things database is now in THL
- Send me email about what does or does not work: ian@mutexlabs.com

If you can't find your THL folders after conversion, click the little 'Show' link on the right of the FOLDERS heading in THL. It's invisible until you mouseover.

## Stuff that isn't converted

- **Areas of Responsibility**. I don't use these enough to bother converting them.
- **Repeating tasks**. I use these a lot, but Things' AppleScript interface does not expose them. I'll have to go dumpster-diving in its SQLite database.
- **Trash**. Didn't care enough.
- **Completion/start/modification/other dates on tasks and folders**. THL doesn't seem to let me change them through AppleScript, so... I'll have to mess with SQLite again.
- Probably lots more that I haven't though of.
